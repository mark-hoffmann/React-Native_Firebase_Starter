# React-Native Firebase Starter

This repo is for creating a boilerplate for React Native projects that utilize Firebase as it's main datastore. We found ourselves copying the same steps over and over again and decided to make a quick script to do it instead.


## Make sure you have node and watchman installed as per the React Native docs
```
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

## Download the React Native CLI
```
sudo npm install -g react-native-cli
```

#Using
To use the script cd to the script on your machine, then pass in 2 arguments via command line
1.) Path for the project to be initiated
2.) Project name

## Ex.
```
python react_start.py /Users/Name/Desktop ProjectName
```
